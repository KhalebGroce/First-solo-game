# First-solo-game
This project was my first attempt at a gaming project within my first Game Design class. We were tasked with making a platformer which I put my own spin on and made a ninja that jumps and throws shuriken. Our professor gave us a two-week timetable and we started with nothing outside of the game idea. Over the next few weeks I worked to develop a platformer in GameMaker Studios2. The primary goal of the project was to create a basic, well-coded platformer. I chose to go above and beyond making my game multiple levels and added a boss fight in the last level. I tried my best to capture my own personality in the game but struggled with the little I knew at the time which is why the game seems very rudimentary. When you begin the game, you are the main character on a tutorial level so you can learn the basic functions of the game. You can toss the shuriken at the zombie to defeat them or simply run and jump past them to get to the flag to advance to the next level. Once you reach the final level the boss will spawn, and you must defeat him to get to the win screen.
